# Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor 
## Introduction 
Hypertension is a condition in which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high. Usually, hypertension is defined as blood pressure above 140/90 and is considered severe if the pressure is above 180/120. It is the most common cause of heart attacks and strokes (‘High blood pressure (hypertension) - Treatment - NHS’, no date), (AHA, 2016). Therefore, monitoring blood pressure is key to prevent heart attacks and stroke. However, most blood monitoring devices can’t digitally store on a web server and provide the key meaning of blood pressure results. Thus, this project aimed at designing a medical device that can measure blood pressure and synchronize it to a database with a possible interpretation of the results. 

The designed system will ease the following: patients’ data management, generation of patients’ progress reports, interpretation of results, and improvement of patient’s health care.

## Implementation 
Figure below shows the setup of the proposed system.

The Prototype consists of a stand-alone blood pressure monitor ([EW3106](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-Diagnostec-EW3106-Pressure-Monitor/dp/B0009OGHRW)) and a wireless module.
